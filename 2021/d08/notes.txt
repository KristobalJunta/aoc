Deriving digits from signal observation

first we get digits that have unique segments count
- 1 has 2 segs
- 7 has 3 segs
- 4 has 4 segs
- 8 has 7 segs

digits 5 and 6 can be derived as they have 1 common segment missing
segment C is not in 5 and 6, but is in all other digits
- 5 has 5 segs and does not include C seg
- 6 has 6 segs and does not include C seg

some digits can then be derived based on the ones we already got
with some help of set algebra:
- 3 has 5 segs and is superset of 1
- 9 has 6 segs and is superset of 4
- 0 has 6 segs and is not a superset of 4

after all this, digit 2 is the last one left
